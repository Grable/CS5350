Hello, TA!
While I do not have any bash scripts, if you run the aptly named concreat.py file, it will use the stochastic and batch gradient descent implementations in LMS.py
There are a few helper methods if you would like to change the increment cap, learning rate, or the difference threshold, just in case.
I have minimal experience with bash scripts, but I was able to get everything to run the way it should in my debugger.
Best,
Gabriel Jarrard
